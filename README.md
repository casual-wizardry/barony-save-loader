# ‚ú® Amy's Barony Save Loader ‚ú®
A program for ~~cheating~~ üòµ‚Äçüí´ _managing save files_ for the game [Barony](https://store.steampowered.com/app/371970/Barony/).

Leaving the program running while you play your game will store saves of your progress at the beginning of each level. Using this, the save loader can restore your progress when you die! üëª

# Setup Info

If you'd like to try it out, here are two methods of setting up the program:

### Method 1: Using Python
If you have Python installed on your computer, then you could run the script directly by following these steps:

1. Navigate to your Barony save directory. (If you have the game on Steam, this will be something like "...\Steam\steamapps\common\Barony\savegames")
      
2. Create a folder there and call it 'saveloader'
      
3. Download the script file called 'saver.py' from the repository and place a copy of it in the 'saveloader' folder.
      
4. Now you can launch the save loader however you would usually launch a Python script. (For example, by navigating to the directory with the command prompt and using the command 'python saver.py')
     
### Method 2: Pre-compiled
Otherwise, you could use the pre-compiled version* as follows:
      
1. Navigate to your Barony save directory. (If you have the game on Steam this will be something like "...\Steam\steamapps\common\Barony\savegames")
      
2. Download the zip archive from the releases tab (currently v1)
      
3. Unzip this and copy the folder called 'saveloader' into your Barony save directory.
      
4. Now you can launch the save loader whenever you like using 'launch.exe.'

\* A note on the pre-compiled version: This was made using the pyinstaller library. It is a little larger than the script by itself simply because pyinstaller includes the files necessary to run the script on a computer without a Python installation. I don't have a lot of experience with pyinstaller, so if anyone notices any issues with this please let me know!

Anyway, if anyone happens to stumble across this and try it out, then I hope that it helps make the game just a little more enjoyable!

Have fun,

Amy <3
